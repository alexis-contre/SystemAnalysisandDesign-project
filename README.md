# DriverPass Project Reflection

## 1. What was the DriverPass project about, who was the client, and what system did they want me to design?
The DriverPass project was for a driving school company that wanted to improve how people get ready for their DMV driving tests. They needed a system that combined online learning with on-the-road lesson scheduling so students could study, take practice exams, and book real driving sessions all in one place. The client was DriverPass, and they wanted a secure, web-based system that worked on desktops and mobile devices, kept track of each student’s progress, let secretaries and admins manage appointments, and updated easily when DMV policies changed.

## 2. What part of my work did I do especially well?
I think I did a great job clearly laying out both the business and technical requirements. In the business requirements doc, I broke down exactly what each user type (students, secretaries, IT admins) needed from the system. In the system design doc, I made sure the technical side covered security, platform support, and infrastructure so the system would actually meet the client’s needs in real life.

## 3. If I could go back and fix one thing, what would it be and how would I make it better?
I’d improve the UML diagrams in my system design document. While I included use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, some of them were a bit basic and didn’t show every detail about how users and processes connect. Next time, I’d spend more time fleshing these out and making them easier for someone else (like a new developer) to understand exactly how the system should work.

## 4. How did I figure out what the client needed and use that in my design? Why is this important?
I carefully read the interview transcript and made sure my requirements matched the client’s pain points — like how students often fail DMV tests because they don’t have proper training, or how secretaries need to manually add student info from walk-ins or phone calls. By turning these into specific requirements and features, I made sure my system design solved real problems. Considering the user’s needs is super important because if you ignore them, you risk building a system that’s confusing, unhelpful, or missing features people actually rely on.

## 5. How do I design software, and what would I do in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I like to break the project into smaller parts — like figuring out what users need first, then what the system has to do technically. I use bulleted lists for requirements and draw UML diagrams to map out how everything connects. In the future, I’d use even more user stories and try prototyping key parts of the interface early on to test with real users. That way, I could catch design flaws sooner and make sure the system actually works the way people expect.
